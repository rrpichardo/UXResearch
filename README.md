# UXResearch

## Purpose & Functionality

UXResearch is a comprehensive web-based experimental research system designed for conducting controlled studies on human-AI interactions. 
It enables researchers to conduct rigorous experimental studies examining how humans interact with AI systems under controlled conditions.
It supports multi-stage experimental designs with randomized treatment groups, ensuring robust data collection for academic research.
Built with Node.js and Express, it provides a complete experimental workflow from participant onboarding, going through a random treatment group's specific configuration, and ends with data collection.


### **Key Research Capabilities:**

- **Hidden Prompt Control**: Researchers can dynamically control AI system instructions that remain invisible to participants, enabling manipulation of AI personality, behavior, or capabilities across experimental conditions
- **Treatment-Group-Specific Flow**: Each treatment group can point to its own hidden prompt, task description, pre-questionnaire blocks, and post-questionnaire blocks, allowing condition-specific study flows without rewriting the app
- **Comprehensive Questionnaire Management**: Full control over pre- and post-interaction questionnaires with configurable question types, block selection, and randomization for measuring baseline characteristics and outcome variables
- **Complex Factorial Experimental Designs**: Support for sophisticated experimental frameworks (2×2, 2×2×2 and beyond) through treatment group configurations, enabling researchers to study multiple independent variables and their interactions simultaneously

## Key Features & Contributions

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5-10 minutes, local)
This section covers the two simplest local paths. Start with the minimal smoke test below. If you want a slightly more realistic single-machine pilot, the second path uses `LOCAL_CODES_FILE` with participant-specific codes while still staying fully local.

#### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrpichardo/UXResearch.git
cd UXResearch
```

#### 2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. **Run a minimal smoke test (no database, no local code file)**
Use the provided test reusable code `REUSABLE_CODE=UXResearch` to skip DB validation and write results to a local file. For a full flow test without calling OpenAI, omit `OPENAI_API_KEY`; the app will use its built-in fake response, or you can override it with `FAKE_LLM_RESPONSE`.

```bash
REUSABLE_CODE=UXResearch \
FAKE_LLM_RESPONSE="This is a fake UXResearch response for local testing." \
RESULTS_FILE=/tmp/results.txt \
node app.js
```

#### 4. **Optional: run locally with participant-specific codes (still no PostgreSQL)**
Generate a local JSON code file:

```bash
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid local_demo --format local-json > /tmp/uxresearch_local_codes.json
```

Then start UXResearch with that local code file:

```bash
EXPERIMENT_ID=local_demo \
LOCAL_CODES_FILE=/tmp/uxresearch_local_codes.json \
FAKE_LLM_RESPONSE="This is a fake UXResearch response for local testing." \
RESULTS_FILE=/tmp/results.txt \
node app.js
```

#### 5. **Connect to the experiment website**
- Open the browser and visit http://localhost:3030 (or the port printed by the server).

#### 6. **Test flow**
- For the minimal smoke test, enter the reusable code `UXResearch`.
- For the local-with-codes path, open `/tmp/uxresearch_local_codes.json` and enter one of the generated codes.
- Walk through consent, baseline questionnaire, the AI chat task, and post-study questionnaire.
- Results will be appended to the file set by `RESULTS_FILE` (default: none) or stored in PostgreSQL if configured.
- For many small ad hoc studies on one machine, these local paths may already be enough.



### Full Deployment (live or public study)

If you only need a local smoke test or a small ad hoc study on one machine, use the local paths in `Getting Started` above. The steps below assume a live or public deployment with PostgreSQL-backed participant codes and result storage.

#### 1. **Start from a local checkout**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrpichardo/UXResearch.git
cd UXResearch
npm install
```

If you already completed the local quick start, you can keep using the same checkout and skip this step.

#### 2. **Configure the Experiment Files**
Configure three core CSV files that control your experimental design:

- **[`experiment_configuration/experiment_desc.csv`](experiment_configuration/experiment_desc.csv)** - Page titles, headers, and body copy for experiment stages; some controls and UI text remain hardcoded in the templates
- **[`experiment_configuration/treatment_groups_config.csv`](experiment_configuration/treatment_groups_config.csv)** - Treatment group assignments, hidden prompts, user preferences, and randomization settings for factorial designs
- **[`experiment_configuration/questions_bank.csv`](experiment_configuration/questions_bank.csv)** - Pre/post questionnaire items, question types, randomization rules, and Likert scale configurations

#### 3. **Set Up PostgreSQL**
For live or public studies, use PostgreSQL for participant-code validation and completed-session storage.

- Create the required tables using [`pre_requisites/postgres_table.txt`](pre_requisites/postgres_table.txt).
- Point `DATABASE_URL` at that database.
- Keep the local-file-backed `LOCAL_CODES_FILE` mode for local or ad hoc single-machine runs; it is already covered in `Getting Started` above.

#### 4. **Generate and Load Participant Codes**
For live deployment, generate codes for a specific experiment ID and load them into `uxresearch_codes`.

Basic generator usage:
```bash
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid your_experiment_id
```

SQL-only output for live deployment:
```bash
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid your_experiment_id --format postgresql > codes.sql
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f codes.sql
```

The helper script is also useful for local runs:
- use the `postgresql` output for live/public deployments
- use the `local json` output for the local-with-codes path in `Getting Started`

Useful generator arguments:
- `--codes-count 100`: number of codes to generate. Default: `100`.
- `--code-len 10`: length of each code. Default: `10`.
- `--seed 42`: optional seed for reproducible code generation. If omitted, the script uses the current Unix timestamp.
- `--format all|csv|postgresql|local-json`: output format. Default: `all`.

Examples:
```bash
# Default combined output for one experiment
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid your_experiment_id

# Reproducible run with more codes
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid your_experiment_id --codes-count 150 --seed 42

# JSON only, ready to save as LOCAL_CODES_FILE
python pre_requisites/generate_codes.py --expid your_experiment_id --format local-json > local_codes.json
```

By default (`--format all`), the script prints three sections:
- `csv`: a simple code list that is easy to inspect or paste into a spreadsheet.
- `postgresql`: an `INSERT` statement block for the `uxresearch_codes` table.
- `local json`: JSON records ready to save into `LOCAL_CODES_FILE`.

For local-file-backed studies, create a JSON file and point `LOCAL_CODES_FILE` to it. Example:

```json
[
  { "code": "participant-001", "expid": "your_experiment_id", "completed": null },
  { "code": "participant-002", "expid": "your_experiment_id", "completed": null },
  { "code": "participant-003", "expid": "your_experiment_id", "completed": null }
]
```

When a participant completes the study, UXResearch updates that record's `completed` field in the same file so the code cannot be reused after a server restart.
If you store codes for several experiments in one combined JSON file, set `EXPERIMENT_ID` so UXResearch uses the matching `expid` records.


#### 5. **Configure Environment Variables**
Typical live-deployment variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
EXPERIMENT_ID=your_experiment_id
SESSION_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret
```

**Required for most live deployments:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for chat completions in live-model studies
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string for database-backed code validation and result storage
- `EXPERIMENT_ID`: Identifier for the experiment
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret used to sign session cookies; set this explicitly for any live or public deployment


**Optional Variables (yet useful). Default values are set in ./config.js:**
- `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 3030).
- `RESULTS_FILE`: Path to append results as lines of JSON (useful for quick capture).
- `LOCAL_CODES_FILE`: Path to a JSON file that stores participant codes and their completion status for local, non-PostgreSQL studies.
- `BASE64_ENCODE`: If set to `1`, saved session payloads will be Base64-encoded. Default: off (`0`).
- `REUSABLE_CODE`: Developer testing code that bypasses DB code-check (for example, `REUSABLE_CODE=UXResearch` during local testing).
- `EXPERIMENT_ID`: Identifier for the experiment.
- `COMPLETE_CODE`: A researcher-defined static completion code given to all participants when they finish the study. Takes priority over `GENERATE_UNIQUE_COMPLETION_CODE`.
- `GENERATE_UNIQUE_COMPLETION_CODE`: If set to `1` and `COMPLETE_CODE` is not set, the server generates a unique 8-character code per participant at completion. The code is shown to the participant and saved to the database.
- `REDIRECT_URL`: URL to redirect participants after completion (used to redirect users back to the referrer site ,e.g. Prolific).
- `OPENAI_TOKEN_LIMIT`: Maximum tokens for OpenAI responses (default is 1000).
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: OpenAI model to use (default `gpt-4o`).
- `FAKE_LLM_RESPONSE`: Fixed assistant reply used when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set. If no API key is provided, this variable is required.
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string for database-backed code validation and result storage.
- `RESULTS_PGTABLE`: PostgreSQL table name for results storage (default `uxresearch_results`).
- `CODES_PGTABLE`: PostgreSQL table name for participant codes (default `uxresearch_codes`).
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret used to sign session cookies. If omitted, the server generates a secure random secret at startup.


#### 6. **Choose a Hosting Target**
Deploy UXResearch anywhere that can run a Node.js web server and expose environment variables, including:

- a local lab server
- Heroku or another PaaS
- AWS, Azure, or GCP
- a container-based host if you package the app for Docker or similar tooling

For live studies, prefer a single running server unless you intentionally redesign session handling and session storage.

#### 7. **Launch the Server**
Example live/public launch command:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here \
PORT=8080 \
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/database \
EXPERIMENT_ID=your_experiment_id \
SESSION_SECRET=replace_with_a_long_random_secret \
COMPLETE_CODE=your_completion_code \
node app.js

# Access at: http://localhost:8080 (or your chosen PORT)
```

## Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow**
1. **Participant Authentication** → Code validation via PostgreSQL, a local JSON code file, or a reusable local test code
2. **Session Initialization** → Treatment group assignment and preferences
3. **Consent Collection** → Digital consent with decline handling
4. **Baseline Measurement** → Pre-study questionnaire administration
5. **Experimental Task** → AI chat interaction with hidden prompts
6. **Outcome Assessment** → Post-study questionnaire collection
7. **Data Collection** → Results serialization and database persistence

### **Backend Components**
- **Express.js Server**: HTTP request handling and middleware
- **Session Management**: Custom class-based session state management
- **CSV Processing**: Dynamic configuration loading
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL integration with connection pooling plus optional local file-backed code and result handling
- **API Integration**: OpenAI chat completions


### **Participant flow (what a participant experiences)**

1. Visit site and enter an access code (a short numeric/string code generated by the researcher).
2. The platform validates the code (unless a configured reusable local test code such as `UXResearch` is being used).
3. The session initializes and assigns a deterministic treatment group based on the participant ID.
4. Participant reads and signs consent (or declines and exits).
5. Participant completes baseline questionnaire.
6. Participant performs the experimental task (chat with the LLM). The LLM receives a hidden system prompt based on the assigned treatment group.
7. Participant completes post-study questionnaires.
8. Session data (responses + full chat log + timestamps) are serialized and saved.

- **Design note:** treatment assignment is deterministic and balanced (uses the participant UID modulo the number of treatment groups), which supports reproducible assignments for analysis.
- **Behavioral note:** if a treatment group has no configured pre-questionnaire or post-questionnaire blocks, that questionnaire stage is skipped automatically.
- **Behavioral note:** if a treatment group has a blank `hidden_prompt`, the chat stage is skipped automatically.


### **Where to put your configuration files**

- `experiment_configuration/treatment_groups_config.csv` — The main controlling csv file for treatment definitions and hidden prompts.
- `experiment_configuration/experiment_desc.csv` — page content and text for each experiment stage.
- `experiment_configuration/questions_bank.csv` — questionnaire items and groupings.
- `experiment_configuration/hidden_prompts_bank/` — prompt files referenced by `treatment_groups_config.csv`.
- `experiment_configuration/user_tasks_bank/` — task descriptions for participants.

**Configuration File Column Reference**

- **`experiment_configuration/treatment_groups_config.csv`**
	- **treatment_group**: Numeric ID for the treatment; used to assign participants to a deterministic group.
	- **user_name**: Display name for the human participant identity (optional; shown in the UI if present).
	- **user_avatar**: Avatar image filename for the participant (from `static/images/avatars`); used in chat UI.
	- **agent_name**: Display name for the agent/AI shown to participants.
	- **agent_avatar**: Avatar image filename for the agent; displayed in chat UI.
		- **hidden_prompt**: Filename (under `experiment_configuration/hidden_prompts_bank/`) containing the system/hidden prompt injected to the LLM for this treatment group (applied at the beginning of the conversation as the system role).
	- **user_task_description**: Filename (under `experiment_configuration/user_tasks_bank/`) or HTML snippet describing the participant task; rendered on the chat page, before the chat begins.
	- **user_pre_questions**: Semicolon-separated question block names (from `questions_bank.csv`) to present before the task.
	- **user_post_questions**: Semicolon-separated question block names (from `questions_bank.csv`) to present after the task.

- **`experiment_configuration/experiment_desc.csv`**
	- **page**: Page key / route name (e.g., `chat`, `consent`, `pre_questionnaire`) used to map CSV rows to site pages.
	- **title**: Page title (used in the HTML `<title>` and page header).
	- **header**: Short header text displayed on the page.
	- **body1**: Main body HTML/text for the page (may include markup). Because this field often contains commas or spans multiple lines, wrap the whole value in double quotes and double any literal `"` characters inside it.

- **`experiment_configuration/questions_bank.csv`**
	- **block_name**: Logical group name for a set of questions (referenced from `treatment_groups_config.csv`).
	- **allow_block_permutation**: `1`/`0` flag — whether blocks may be permuted (randomized) when shown.
	- **allow_question_permutation**: `1`/`0` flag — whether questions inside the block may be permuted.
	- **question_name**: Unique identifier/key for the question (used as the response field name in saved results).
	- **question_text**: The question prompt or instructions (may include HTML); shown to participants.
	- **is_text**: `1`/`0` — render a free-text input when `1`.
	- **is_likert**: `1`/`0` — render a Likert-style scale (single item) when `1`.
	- **is_grouped_likert**: `1`/`0` — render a grouped/matrix Likert (multiple labeled items sharing the same scale) when `1`.
	- **is_multi_choice**: `1`/`0` — render a multiple-choice input when `1`.
	- **is_label**: `1`/`0` — indicates the row is a non-input label/header (not a response item).
	- **options**: Pipe-separated (`|`) option labels or scale endpoints; used for `is_likert`, `is_multi_choice`, and grouped-likert options.

Notes:
- Flags are treated as truthy (`1`) / falsy (`0`) in code; conform to that convention in CSVs.
- `user_pre_questions` and `user_post_questions` in the treatment CSV should match `block_name` values in `questions_bank.csv` (semicolon-separated).
- `hidden_prompt` should reference a plain text file in `experiment_configuration/hidden_prompts_bank/` and will be used as the LLM system message.
- `user_task_description` should point to an HTML file under `experiment_configuration/user_tasks_bank/` to render task instructions.
- **CSV quoting**: these are standard comma-separated files parsed by the [`csv-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csv-parser) npm package. In the current UXResearch loader, quoted fields correctly support commas, embedded newlines, and doubled double quotes (`""`). This matters especially in `experiment_desc.csv`, where HTML snippets often span multiple lines. If a field value contains a comma or newline, wrap it in double quotes. To include a literal double quote inside a quoted field, double it.

Example `experiment_desc.csv` value:

```csv
consent,UXResearch,Example Consent Information,"<p>Line 1, with a comma.</p>
<p>She said ""hello"" here.</p>"
```

### **Question Types**

The questionnaire framework supports five question types, each optimized for different types of data collection:

#### **1. Text (`is_text`)**
- **Appearance**: Single or multi-line text input box.
- **Use case**: Open-ended responses, opinions, explanations, free-form feedback.
- **Options**: No structured options; participants enter arbitrary text.
- **Example CSV**: `is_text: 1`, all other type flags `0`.

#### **2. Likert Scale (`is_likert`)**
- **Appearance**: Single horizontal or vertical scale with labeled endpoints and intermediate points.
- **Use case**: Measuring agreement, satisfaction, or attitude on a single dimension (e.g., "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree").
- **Options**: Defined in the `options` column as pipe-separated endpoints and midpoints (e.g., `Strongly Disagree|Disagree|Neutral|Agree|Strongly Agree`).
- **Example CSV**: `is_likert: 1`, `options: "1|2|3|4|5"` or `options: "Strongly Disagree|Agree"`.

#### **3. Grouped Likert / Matrix (`is_grouped_likert`)**
- **Appearance**: Multiple labeled rows (items) sharing the same Likert scale; renders as an efficient matrix table when consecutive questions use the same scale.
- **Use case**: Measuring multiple related items on a common scale (e.g., rating multiple AI traits or task aspects).
- **Options**: Defined in the `options` column (shared scale, same as single Likert).
- **Grouping behavior**: Consecutive `is_grouped_likert` questions with identical `options` are automatically combined into a single matrix table. Non-consecutive grouped Likerts or those with different scales render individually.
- **Example CSV**: Multiple rows with `is_grouped_likert: 1` and the same `options: "1|2|3|4|5"`.

#### **4. Multiple Choice (`is_multi_choice`)**
- **Appearance**: Radio buttons or dropdown with mutually exclusive options.
- **Use case**: Selecting one answer from a fixed set (e.g., "What is your primary use case?").
- **Options**: Defined in the `options` column as pipe-separated choices (e.g., `Option A|Option B|Option C`).
- **Example CSV**: `is_multi_choice: 1`, `options: "Yes|No|Unsure"`.

#### **5. Label (`is_label`)**
- **Appearance**: Static text, header, or instructional content (no input field).
- **Use case**: Breaking up questionnaires with section headers, instructions, or visual separators.
- **Options**: No options; the `question_text` field contains the HTML/text to display.
- **Example CSV**: `is_label: 1`, `question_text: "<h3>Section 2: AI Trustworthiness</h3>"`.

#### **Questions and Blocks**

Questions are organized into **blocks** — named groups that can be assigned to treatment groups via the `user_pre_questions` and `user_post_questions` columns in `treatment_groups_config.csv`. Blocks provide flexibility:
- Each block can be **independently randomized** (block permutation, question permutation, or both) via the `allow_block_permutation` and `allow_question_permutation` flags.
- Different treatment groups can present different blocks (e.g., group A gets a "Trust" block, group B gets an "Anthropomorphism" block).
- Each question is **uniquely identified by its `question_name`**. See the Limitations section at the end of this README.

## Output Data

### **Raw saved result objects**

If `RESULTS_FILE` is set, the server appends one JSON object per completed session. Each line is a wrapper object like:

```json
{"time":"2026-03-26T01:07:01.293Z","uid":"60729","userid":"60729","data":"{...session payload...}"}
```

- `time`: server-side save time
- `uid`: UXResearch session UID
- `userid`: either the Prolific identifier object or the internal UID
- `data`: the saved session payload

If `BASE64_ENCODE=1`, the `data` field is Base64-encoded. Otherwise it is saved as plain JSON text.

### **Decoded session payload**

The decoded session payload contains the full experiment session that UXResearch serializes from the active session state. Common fields include:

- `uid`: internal session identifier
- `sessionStartTime`: ISO timestamp for session start
- `userQuestionnaireEndedTime`: ISO timestamp for final questionnaire submission
- `prolificUid`: stored Prolific identifiers from the query string, when present
- `code`: participant access code used for entry
- `treatmentGroupId`: assigned treatment group
- `preferences`: displayed user and agent names and avatar paths
- `systemRoleHiddenContent`: hidden prompt actually used for the chat
- `conversationContext`: ordered chat turns, each with `role`, `content`, and `interactionTime`
- `preQuestionsAnswers`: object keyed by pre-questionnaire `question_name`
- `postQuestionsAnswers`: object keyed by post-questionnaire `question_name`
- `completionCode`: optional completion code shown at the end of the study
- `completionRedirectUrl`: optional redirect target shown at completion
- `sessionEndedHeaderOverride` and `sessionEndedBodyOverride`: custom completion or opt-out messaging, when used
- `lastInteractionTime`, `chatEnded`, `finished`, `consent`, and `userid`: additional session state and identifiers

Example decoded payload excerpt:

```json
{
  "uid": "60729",
  "sessionStartTime": "2026-03-26T00:57:57.694Z",
  "treatmentGroupId": 3,
  "preferences": {
    "user_name": "You",
    "agent_name": "",
    "agent_avatar": "static/images/avatars/user_avatar_01.png"
  },
  "conversationContext": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.", "interactionTime": 0 }
  ],
  "postQuestionsAnswers": {
    "Habit1": "5",
    "comment_1": "No"
  },
  "completionCode": "87843F58"
}
```

This output is intentionally rich and low-level. Researchers can derive scale scores, timing variables, engagement measures, prompt-condition comparisons, or custom coding schemes during downstream analysis.

## What You Can Configure Without Code

- Questionnaire blocks, question wording, question types, and permutation settings in `experiment_configuration/questions_bank.csv`
- Page titles, headers, and selected body text in `experiment_configuration/experiment_desc.csv`
- Treatment-group assignments, prompts, task descriptions, questionnaire blocks, and displayed names or avatars in `experiment_configuration/treatment_groups_config.csv`
- Hidden prompt text in `experiment_configuration/hidden_prompts_bank/`
- Participant task instructions in `experiment_configuration/user_tasks_bank/`

## What Typically Requires Code Changes

- **CSS**: visual styling changes in `static/stylesheets/style.css`
- **HTML / Pug views**: consent controls, chat layout, or page structure changes in `views/*.pug`
- **Backend JavaScript**: routing, saving logic, session behavior, or LLM-provider integration changes in `app.js`, `helpers.js`, and `sessionManagement.js`

## Default Questionnaire UI Constraints

- Text questions render as single-line text inputs in the default UI
- Multiple-choice questions render as single-select radio buttons
- Likert and grouped-Likert items render as fixed 7-point scales with left and right endpoint labels
- Grouped Likert items are combined only when consecutive rows share the same options
- If question randomization is enabled for a block, keep at most one label row in that block
- `question_name` values should be globally unique across the entire question bank
- Answer-based conditional branching is not implemented in the default questionnaire renderer

### **Server Initialization**

On the **first request** (any route), the `verifySystemInitialized` middleware calls `helpers.waitForSystemInitializiation()`. This is a one-time async bootstrap that:

1. **Reads all CSVs** (`helpers.readAllCsvFiles()`):
   - Scans `experiment_configuration/` for `*.csv` files.
   - Streams each file through the `csv-parser` library and collects rows into `csvDB[filename]`.
   - Populates three in-memory arrays used throughout the app:
     - `treatmentFroupConfigRecords` ← `treatment_groups_config.csv`
     - `userQuestionnaireRecords` ← `questions_bank.csv`
     - `experimentDescRecords` ← `experiment_desc.csv`
   - Derives `treatmentGroups` — a deduplicated sorted array of `treatment_group` integers; used for assignment math.

2. **Loads file banks** (`helpers.loadFileBank()`):
   - Reads every file in `hidden_prompts_bank/` into the `hiddenPromptsBank` object (`filename → string content`).
   - Reads every file in `user_tasks_bank/` into `userTasksBank` (`filename → HTML string`).

3. Sets `isSystemInitialized = true`; subsequent requests skip all of the above instantly.

### **Session Lifecycle**

Every request passes through a shared middleware stack defined in `app.use([...])`:

```
verifySystemInitialized → verifySession → verifySessionEnded
```

#### `verifySession`
Runs on every request. If the session has no UID yet (new visitor):
- Generates a random integer UID (`0`–`maxUID`).
- Assigns a **treatment group**: `treatmentGroups[uid % treatmentGroups.length]` — deterministic and balanced across groups.
- Extracts Prolific URL parameters (`prolific_pid`, `study_id`, `session_id`) from the query string.
- Calls `sessionManager.initialize()` and `sessionManager.setPreferences()` (loads avatar filenames and display names from the treatment group row).

#### `verifySessionEnded`
If `sessionManager.getFinished()` is `true` (set either on consent decline or post-questionnaire submission):
- Fetches rendering params for the `session_ended` page.
- Applies any header/body overrides stored in the session (e.g., "You opted out" for declines).
- Injects `completion_code` and `redirect_url` if configured.
- Renders `./session_ended`.
- If consent was given: calls `handleUserCompleted()` — serializes session to JSON (optionally Base64-encoded), writes to `RESULTS_FILE` and/or inserts into the PostgreSQL results table, marks the participant code as completed in the configured local JSON file or PostgreSQL table when applicable, then destroys the session.
- If consent was declined: destroys the session without saving.

### **GET `/` — The Participant Flow (Middleware Chain)**

All participant-facing pages are served from a single `GET /` route, guarded by an ordered middleware chain. Each middleware either **renders a page and stops**, or **calls `next()`** to pass control to the next stage. This enforces a strict linear flow:

```
renderSessionCode → renderUserConsent → renderPreQuestionnaire → renderChat → renderChatQuestionnaire
```

#### 1. `renderSessionCode` — Code Entry
- **Condition**: `sessionManager.getCode()` is falsy.
- Calls `helpers.getRenderingParamsForPage("welcome_code")` → looks up the `welcome_code` row in `experimentDescRecords` → returns `{ title, header_message, body_message }`.
- Adds `form_type: "welcome_code"` to render params.
- Renders `./welcome_code`.

#### 2. `renderUserConsent` — Informed Consent
- **Condition**: `sessionManager.getConsent()` is falsy.
- Fetches rendering params for `"consent"` (including the full consent HTML from the `body1` CSV column).
- Adds `form_type: "consent"`.
- Renders `./consent`.

#### 3. `renderPreQuestionnaire` — Pre-Study Questionnaire
- **Condition**: `sessionManager.getPreQuestionsAnswers()` is falsy.
- Calls `helpers.getUserTestQuestions(req, "user_pre_questions")`:
  - Reads the `user_pre_questions` column of the participant's treatment group row (semicolon-separated block names).
  - For each block name, filters `userQuestionnaireRecords` and assembles question objects (`name`, `label`, `is_text`, `is_likert`, `is_grouped_likert`, `is_multi_choice`, `is_label`, `choices`).
  - Applies block-level and question-level permutation (Fisher-Yates shuffle) if `allow_block_permutation` / `allow_question_permutation` flags are set.
  - Groups consecutive `is_grouped_likert` questions sharing the same scale endpoints into a single matrix widget.
- If no questions → auto-sets answers to `{}` and redirects to `/` (skips stage).
- Otherwise renders `./user_questionnaire` with `form_type: "pre_questionnaire"`.

#### 4. `renderChat` — AI Chat Task
- **Condition**: `sessionManager.getChatEnded()` is falsy.
- Calls `helpers.setSelectedHiddenPromptToSession(req)`:
  - Looks up `hidden_prompt` filename from the treatment group row.
  - Reads the file content from `hiddenPromptsBank` and stores it in the session as the system role content.
- If the hidden prompt is empty (blank `hidden_prompt` cell) → **skips the chat stage** by marking `chatEnded = true` and calling next.
- Otherwise fetches rendering params for `"chat"`, attaches:
  - `preferences` (user/agent names and avatar paths from `getUserPreferences()`).
  - `task_description` (HTML from `userTasksBank`, keyed by the `user_task_description` column).
  - `form_type: "chat_ended"`.
- Renders `./chat`.

#### 5. `renderChatQuestionnaire` — Post-Study Questionnaire
- **Condition**: `sessionManager.getQuestionsAnswers()` is falsy.
- Calls `helpers.getUserTestQuestions(req, "user_post_questions")` (same logic as pre-questionnaire, using the `user_post_questions` column).
- Renders `./user_questionnaire` with `form_type: "post_questionnaire"`.

---

### **POST `/submit_user_response` — Unified Form Handler**

All form submissions POST to a single endpoint. The `form_type` hidden field (injected into every rendered form) determines which handler runs:

| `form_type` | Handler | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `welcome_code` | `handleWelcomeCodeSubmission` | Validates the submitted code against the configured local JSON code file or DB (`SELECT completed WHERE code=? AND expid=?`), or accepts the configured reusable test code (for example, `UXResearch`). On success, stores code in session. Reconciles `prolific_pid` if it differs between URL param and form field. |
| `consent` | `handleConsentSubmission` | Checks all `consent.*` fields for `"YES"`. Any non-YES → sets `finished=true` with opt-out messaging. Otherwise sets `consent=true`. |
| `pre_questionnaire` | `handlePreQuestionnaireSubmission` | Stores the entire `req.body` (all question responses) into `sessionManager.setPreQuestionsAnswers()`. |
| `chat_ended` | `handleChatEndedSubmission` | Sets `sessionManager.setChatEnded(true)`. Triggered when the participant clicks "End Chat" in the UI. |
| `post_questionnaire` | `handlePostQuestionnaireSubmission` | Stores answers, sets `finished=true`, attaches `redirect_url` and `completion_code` from config, records the questionnaire end timestamp. |

After every handler, the request is redirected to `GET /`, where the middleware chain re-evaluates and advances to the next stage.

### **POST `/chat-api` — LLM Proxy**

Called by the chat UI for each message turn:
1. Appends `{ role: "user", content, interactionTime }` to the session's conversation context.
2. Builds the full prompt: `[{ role: "system", content: <hiddenPrompt> }, ...conversationHistory]`.
3. Calls OpenAI's `chat.completions.create` with the configured model, token limit, and temperature.
4. Appends `{ role: "assistant", content: reply }` to the session context.
5. Returns the reply text to the client.

The current implementation uses the OpenAI chat completions format, where the full conversation passed to the API is a flat array of messages with alternating roles:

```javascript
[
  { role: "system",    content: "<hidden prompt text>" },
  { role: "user",      content: "Hello, can you help me?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Of course! What do you need?" },
  { role: "user",      content: "..." },
  // ... full history for every turn
]
```

The entire history is re-sent on every turn, which gives the model full conversation context.

#### **Swapping the LLM provider**

The entire LLM integration is isolated in a single function in `app.js`:

```javascript
async function getLLMResponse(conversation) { ... }
```

To use a different provider, replace only this function. The contract is:
- **Input**: `conversation` — an array of `{ role, content }` message objects in OpenAI chat format (system message first, followed by alternating user/assistant turns).
- **Output**: a `Promise<string>` — the assistant's reply text.

Example swap for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., a local Ollama server):

```javascript
async function getLLMResponse(conversation) {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ model: 'llama3', messages: conversation })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

Nothing else in the codebase needs to change — the route handler, session context management, and hidden prompt injection are all provider-agnostic.

## Limitations

### **Session storage and deployment**

- The default deployment uses the built-in in-memory Express session store, so UXResearch should be treated as a single-server application unless you intentionally redesign session storage.
- If `SESSION_SECRET` is auto-generated at startup, active sessions become invalid after server restart.
- If multiple servers need to share the same sessions, they must all use the same `SESSION_SECRET` and a shared session store. That is not implemented by default.

### **Participant-code behavior**

- Participant codes are simple short strings, not cryptographic tokens. In typical research deployments this is acceptable because codes are distributed out-of-band and marked as completed after use.
- Participant codes are marked as completed only at the final submission step. If a participant starts, closes the study before finishing, and later begins a new session, the same code can still be accepted and produce a second completed record. Researchers should check for duplicate completions during data cleaning.

### **Data persistence**

- Incomplete sessions are not saved. Only sessions that reach the final submission step are persisted to `RESULTS_FILE` and or PostgreSQL.
- If you enable `RESULTS_FILE`, the raw saved output is a wrapper JSON object whose `data` field may contain plain JSON text or Base64-encoded JSON depending on `BASE64_ENCODE`.

### **Configuration robustness**

- All three configuration CSVs are loaded at startup with minimal validation. Malformed CSVs, broken quoting, missing columns, or mismatched block names can crash the server or produce runtime errors.
- `question_name` values in `questions_bank.csv` must be globally unique. Reusing the same `question_name` in multiple blocks causes later answers to overwrite earlier ones.
- Answer-based conditional branching is not implemented in the default questionnaire renderer. Condition-specific flow is achieved through treatment-group configuration instead.

### **Default UI constraints**

- Text questions render as single-line inputs in the default questionnaire template.
- Multiple-choice questions are single-select radio buttons.
- Likert and grouped-Likert items use a fixed 7-point scale in the default UI.
- Grouped Likert rows are merged only when consecutive items share the same `options` values.
- If question randomization is enabled for a block, use at most one label row in that block.

### **Automatic stage skipping**

- If a treatment group leaves `hidden_prompt` blank, UXResearch skips the chat stage automatically.
- If a treatment group has no configured pre-questionnaire or post-questionnaire blocks, UXResearch skips that questionnaire stage automatically.
